After downloading the RAW data, the dataset had a unique Ride ID, bike type, started_at & ended_at in date-time format, start station name with a unique station id for each station
and the same for the end station name with a unique ID for each end station, start & end latitudes and longitudes and finally the membership type (casual & member).

* First step was to remove the start_station_id and end_station_id columns as they were redundant to the analysis process.

* Second step was to create filters for each of the columns and check for any blank values. There were blank values in both the start_station_name and end_station_name columns. Upon
filtering, the blank rows from both values were deleted.

* Next was creating separate columns for start_date & start_time, end_date and end_time. Since the started_at & ended_at columns were in date-time format, the start date was derived
using the formula: =INT(value). The result was then changed to a short-date format. For the start_time column, the formula: =value-INT(value) was applied and the result was converted
to the time format. Note - using standard notations for the values in the formula. The same steps were repeated for the end_date and end_time calculations.

* After the start_time and end_time columns were created with the relevant values, the ride duration was calculated using the formula: =IF(value2>value1, value2-value1, value2+1-* After the start_time and end_time columns were created with the relevant values, the ride duration was calculated using the formula: =IF(value2>value1, value2-value1, value2+1-D2). Note that
some rides started after 11 PM and ended after 12 AM the next day. So just subtracting the end_date from the start_date would lead to null values for such rides. Hence, the 
above-mentioned IF Function was used. The ride duration was derived in HH:MM:SS format.

* To convert the ride duration from HH:MM:SS format to minute format, the following formula was implemented: =(HOUR(value)*60)+MINUTE(value)+SECOND(value)/60 and the subsequent
values were converted to Number format.

* Post this, the day on which the ride was completed was determined under the column name - day_week using the formula: =WEEKDAY(value, 1) where the results would be derived from
the start_date values and the results would be displayed in integers from 1 to 7 representing the days of the week with 1 being 'Sunday" and 7 being 'Saturday'.

* Next, the start_station_names and end_station_names were trimmed to remove any unwanted spaces.

* After this, the distance travelled was calculated from the start & end latitudes and longitudes using the formula: =ACOS(COS(RADIANS(90-end_lat)) *COS(RADIANS(90-start_lat)) +SIN(RADIANS(90-end_lat)) *SIN(RADIANS(90-start_lat)) *COS(RADIANS(end_long-start_long))) *6371.
The *6371 multiplication was used to retrieve the results in kilometres.

* Lastly, the member_type column was trimmed to remove unwanted spaces.

* The final data cleaning was centred on the ride_duration and distance_km columns where values of 0 mins and distances ranging from 0.001 km to 0.009 km were deleted as these
would be NULL values and would hamper the analysis process.

After the Data Cleaning was completed in Excel, all the datasets were then individually uploaded to MSSQL Server.
